# GEOG5995
### Assignment 2 of GEOG 5995 - Site Location Problem
 
## About
 
This project takes three raster input files to create a map of Great Britain in a 530 x 335 grid. The raster files contain values representing the population, geology and transportation options available in that area.

Running through the model creates a window in the notebook which shows a map with population, geology and transportation set to equal weights. There are three sliders which allow the user to adjust the weights to their preference on a scale of 0 to 100. Please note that setting all of the weights to 0 will cause the program to have an error. 

The final block of code allows the user to view the map, adjust weights for each attribute, submit updated weights and save the weighted raster data to an output file named 'ouput.txt'.

## Installation

The program is included in the zip file with this README. If you do not have the zip file it can be found in the relevant github repository at ************* 

## Running the model

In order to run this model, you will need to unzip the Assignment 2 folder, open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the directory of the unzipped folder and open the Site Location notebook. 

Once open, the user will need to run through the code from top to bottom.
